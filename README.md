# Pyramid Explorer

A Three.js web application that offers an interactive 3D exploration of the Great Pyramids of Giza, highlighting their mathematical properties and architectural significance.

## Features

- 3D visualization of the Giza pyramid complex with accurate relative positioning
- Interactive elements: click on pyramids to learn about their history and mathematics
- Dynamic lighting system that simulates different times of day
- Particle effects for enhanced visual experience
- Mobile-responsive design
- Information panel highlighting the mathematical coincidences and mysteries of the pyramids

## Mathematical Coincidences Explored

This application visualizes and explains several fascinating mathematical properties of the pyramids:

- The relationship between the Great Pyramid's dimensions and π (Pi)
- The Golden Ratio (φ) incorporated in the pyramid design
- The Orion Correlation Theory
- The coordinate coincidence with the speed of light
- Other mathematical and astronomical alignments
